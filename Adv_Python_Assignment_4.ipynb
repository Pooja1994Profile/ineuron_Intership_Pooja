    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) _ _getitem_ _ or _ _iter_ _.\n",
    "In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use _ _iter_ _ (which returns an object that\n",
    "supports the iteration protocol with a next method) first: if no _ _iter_ _ is found\n",
    "by inheritance search, Python falls back on the _ _getitem_ _ indexing method\n",
    "(which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    " Printing sue ultimately runs the GenericDisplay._ _str_ _ method and the\n",
    "GenericDisplay.gatherAttrs method it calls. In more detail, to print sue, the\n",
    "print statement converts her to her user-friendly display string by passing her to\n",
    "the built-in str function. In a class, this means look for a _ _str_ _ operator overloading method by \n",
    "inheritance search, and run it if it is found. sue’s class, Employee,\n",
    "does not have a _ _str_ _ method; Person is searched next, and eventually _ _str_ _\n",
    "is found in the GenericDisplay class.\n",

    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The __getitem__ method is used for accessing list items, array elements, dictionary entries etc. \n",
    "slice is a constructor in Python that creates slice object to represent set of indices that the \n",
    "range(start, stop, step) specifies. __getitem__ method can be implement in a class, and the behavior \n",
    "of slicing can be defined inside it.\n",
    "Eg;\n",
    "class Demo:\n",
    "    def __getitem__(self, key):\n",
    "          \n",
    "        # print a[1], a[1, 2], \n",
    "        # a[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "        print(key)\n",
    "          \n",
    "        return key\n",
    "a = Demo()\n",
    "a[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "OOP is about code reuse—you factor code to minimize redundancy and program by customizing what already exists \n",
    "instead of changing code in-place or starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "One overloading method seems to show up in almost every realistic class: the _ _init_ _\n",
    "constructor method. Because it allows classes to fill out the attributes in their newly\n",
    "created instances immediately, the constructor is useful for almost every kind of class\n",
    "you might code. In fact, even though instance attributes are not declared in Python,\n",
    "you can usually find out which attributes an instance will have by inspecting its class’\n",
    "_ _init_ _ method code.\n",
