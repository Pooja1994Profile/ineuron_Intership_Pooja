    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches. One of the popular \n",
    "approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming \n",
    "(OOP). An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "attributes\n",
    "behavior\n",
    "Ex, A parrot is an object, as it has the following properties:\n",
    "name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY \n",
    "(Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "to access the attributes of the module, call the method of the object, etc. For an object generated by a class \n",
    "statement, this expression starts with a search in Python-it searches the related tree of an object, Find the \n",
    "place where the attribute first appears. After the class is added, the subsequent processing can be expressed \n",
    "in the natural language.\n",
    "in other words,Fetching attributes is tree search. The term inheritance also applies, because lower-level objects \n",
    "in the tree inherit properties from higher-level objects. With the continuous advancement from bottom to top, in \n",
    "a sense,The object in the tree is the union of all the attributes defined in its parent object。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete \n",
    "'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word \n",
    "'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class.\n",
    "This is easy to understand if you look at an example. For example, suppose you have a class House. \n",
    "Your own house is an object and is an instance of class House. Your sister's house is another object \n",
    "(another instance of class House).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Special method named __init__(), When a class defines an __init__() method, class instantiation automatically \n",
    "invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The __init__ method is similar to constructors. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. \n",
    "The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of \n",
    "class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that \n",
    "are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "class Tree:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "t=Tree(), t is the instance of Tree Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Answer: An object is created from a class using the new keyword. There are three steps when creating an object \n",
    "from a class −\n",
    "Declaration − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.\n",
    "Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.\n",
    "Initialization − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.\n",
    "Ex;\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "     'Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords.'\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        ' Create a new point at the origin '\n",
    "        self.x = 0\n",
    "        self.y = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The class whose subclass has been made is called a superclass. Other names of superclass are base class or \n",
    "parent class, and other names of subclass are derived class or child class. In our Rectangle example, Rectangle \n",
    "is the superclass and Square is its subclass. The process of creating a subclass of a class is called inheritance.\n",
    "EX;\n",
    "# superclass\n",
    "class Person():\n",
    "    def display1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is superclass\")\n",
    " \n",
    "# subclass\n",
    "class Employee(Person):\n",
    "    def display2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is subclass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "emp = Employee()  # creating object of subclass\n",

    "emp.display1()\n",
    "emp.display2()\n",
