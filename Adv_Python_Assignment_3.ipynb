    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An abstract superclass is a class that calls a method, but does not inherit or\n",
    "define it—it expects the method to be filled in by a subclass. This is often used\n",
    "as a way to generalize classes when behavior cannot be predicted until a more\n",
    "specific subclass is coded. OOP frameworks also use this as a way to dispatch to\n",
    "client-defined, customizable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When a simple assignment statement (X=Y) appears at the top level of a class\n",
    "statement, it attaches a data attribute to the class (Class,X). Like all class\n",
    "attributes, this will be shared by all instances; data attributes are not callable\n",
    "method functions, though. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A class must manually call the _ _init_ _ method in a superclass if it defines an\n",
    "_ _init_ _ constructor of its own, but must still kick off the superclass’\n",
    "construction code. Python itself automatically runs just one constructor—the\n",
    "lowest one in the tree. Superclass constructors are called through the class\n",
    "name, passing in the self instance manually: Superclass._ _init_ _(self, ...).\n",
    "Ex;\n",
    "class Person():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, per_name, per_age):\n",
    "        self.name = per_name\n",
    "        self.age = per_age\n",
    "# subclass\n",
    "class Employee(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, emp_name, emp_age, emp_salary):\n",
    "        self.salary = emp_salary\n",
    "        Person.__init__(self, emp_name, emp_age)\n",
    "\n",
    "emp = Employee(\"John\", 20, 8000)  # creating object of superclass\n",
    " \n",
    "print(\"name:\", emp.name, \"age:\", emp.age, \"salary:\", emp.salary)\n",
    "\n",
    "We created an object emp of the subclass Employee by passing the values “John”, 20 and 8000 to the emp_name,\n",
    "emp_age and emp_salary parameters of the constructor of the child class (because the child class has a constructor\n",
    "of its own). In this constructor, the value of emp_salary is assigned to the attribute salary of the object emp, \n",
    "and the constructor of the parent class is called by passing emp_name and emp_age as the arguments. In the \n",
    "constructor of the parent class, the attributes name and age becomes “John” and 20 respectively for the object \n",
    "emp.\n",

    "4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "To augment instead of completely replacing an inherited method, redefine it in a\n",
    "subclass, but call back to the superclass’ version of the method manually from\n",
    "the new version of the method in the subclass. That is, pass the self instance to\n",
    "the superclass’ version of the method manually: Superclass.method(self, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Every block (code appearing between a { and } ) defines a new scope - the region in a program where a name, \n",
    "usually a variable, is visible and accessible. Although blocks can be nested arbitrarily deep, there are only \n",
    "three main or named levels of scope:\n",
    "Local: inside a function\n",
    "Global: outside all functions and classes\n",
    "Class: inside a class (i.e., an attribute or a member variable)\n",
