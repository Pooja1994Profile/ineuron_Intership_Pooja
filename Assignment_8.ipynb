    "1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "Answer:PyInputPlus is not a part of the Python Standard Library, need to include using pip install PyInputPlus\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n",
    "Answer:  The as pyip code in the import statement saves us from typing pyinputplus each time we want to call a \n",
    "PyInputPlus function. Instead we can use the shorter pyip name. If you take a look at the example, you see that \n",
    "unlike input(), these functions return an int or float value: 42 and 3.14 instead of the strings '42' and '3.14'.\n",

    "3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Prompts the user to enter an integer value. Returns the integer as an int value.\n",
    "Prompts the user to enter a floating point number value. Returns the number as a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "Answer:Using min and max parameters,\n",
    "min (None, float): If not None, the minimum accepted numeric value, including the minimum argument.\n",
    "max (None, float): If not None, the maximum accepted numeric value, including the maximum argument.\n",

    "5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "allowRegexes (Sequence, None): A sequence of regex str that will explicitly pass validation.\n",
    "blockRegexes (Sequence, None): A sequence of regex str or (regex_str, error_msg_str) tuples that, \n",
    "if matched, will explicitly fail validation.\n",

    "6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "Answer: The number of tries the user has to enter valid input before the default value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?\n",
    "Answer: The number of tries the user has to enter valid input before the default value \"hello\" is returned.\n",
