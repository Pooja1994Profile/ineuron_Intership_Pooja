    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Lambda functions: are operator can have any number of arguments, but it can have only one expression. It cannot \n",
    "contain any statements and it returns a function object which can be assigned to any variable. They can be used \n",
    "in the block they were created.\n",
    "def functions: Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger \n",
    "and larger, functions make it more organised and manageable. They can be called and used anywhere we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "lambda is an anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.\n",
    "This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n",
    "One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.\n",
    "You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n",
    "It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other types of expressions in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The map(), filter() and reduce() functions bring a bit of functional programming to Python. All three of these \n",
    "are convenience functions that can be replaced with List Comprehensions or loops, but provide a more elegant and \n",
    "short-hand approach to some problems.\n",
    "map() function: The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function \n",
    "we passed as an argument on each of them.\n",
    "map(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "filter() function: As the name suggests, filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a \n",
    "certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True.\n",
    "filter(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce() function: reduce() works differently than map() and filter(). It does not return a new list based on the \n",
    "function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value.\n",
    "reduce(function, sequence[, initial])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Function annotations are completely optional both for parameters and return value.\n",
    "Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions\n",
    "at compile time.\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "def foo(**args: expression, **kwargs: expression):\n",
    "    â€¦.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "def func(x:'annotating x', y: 'annotating y', z: int) -> float: print(x + y + z)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. A a function can call other functions. \n",
    "It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "def factorial(x):\n",
    "    \"This is a recursive functito find the factorial of an integer\"\n",
    "    if x == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return (x * factorial(x-1))\n",
    "num = 3\n",
    "print(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1) In order to be forward compatible, function annotations in Python 3 code should preferably use PEP 484 syntax. \n",
    "(There are some formatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section.)\n",
    "2) The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged.\n",
    "3) However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of PEP 484 are now encouraged. For example, \n",
    "marking up a large third party library or application with PEP 484 style type annotations, reviewing how easy \n",
    "it was to add those annotations, and observing whether their presence increases code understandability.\n",
    "4) The Python standard library should be conservative in adopting such annotations, but their use is allowed for \n",
    "new code and for big refactorings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "function defination \n",
    "function call\n",
    "function output\n",
    "\n",
