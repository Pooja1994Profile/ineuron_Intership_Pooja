    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Classes are made by running class statements; instances are created by calling a\n",
    "class as though it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Instance attributes are created by assigning attributes to an instance object. They\n",
    "are normally created within class method functions inside the class statement by\n",
    "assigning attributes to the self argument (which is always the implied instance).\n",
    "Again, though, they may be created by assignment anywhere a reference to the\n",
    "instance appears, even outside the class statement. Normally, all instance\n",
    "attributes are initialized in the _ _init_ _ constructor method; that way, later\n",
    "method calls can assume the attributes already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to only one object. It is only accessible in the scope of \n",
    "the object and it is defined inside the constructor function of a class. For example, __init__(self,..).\n",
    "Eg;\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods\n",
    "of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.The reason you need to use self. is \n",
    "because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way \n",
    "that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: \n",
    "the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "self is the name commonly given to the first (leftmost) argument in a class\n",
    "method function; Python automatically fills it in with the instance object that is\n",
    "the implied subject of the method call. This argument need not be called self;\n",
    "its position is what is significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Operator overloading is coded in a Python class with specially named methods;\n",
    "they all begin and end with double underscores to make them unique. These are\n",
    "not built-in or reserved names; Python just runs them automatically when an\n",
    "instance appears in the corresponding operation. Python defines the mappings\n",
    "from operations to special method names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Operator overloading is useful to implement objects that resemble built-in types\n",
    "(e.g., sequences or numeric objects such as matrixes), and to mimic the built-in\n",
    "type interface expected by a piece of code. Mimicking built-in type interfaces\n",
    "enables you to pass in class instances that also have state information—i.e.,\n",
    "attributes that remember data between operation calls. You shouldn’t use operator \n",
    "overloading when a simple named method will suffice, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The _ _init_ _ constructor method is the most commonly used; almost every\n",
    "class uses this method to set initial values for instance attributes and perform\n",
    "other startup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Special self argument in method functions and the _ _init_ _ constructor method\n",
